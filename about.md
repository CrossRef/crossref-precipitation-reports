## Crossref Precipitation  Reports

It's raining metdata! Hallelujah!

### Warnings, Caveats and Weasel Words

This is a [Crossref Labs](https://www.crossref.org/labs/) version of our production [Particpation reports](https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/).

Trust it as you would a scorpoion sitting on your nose.

### Why have we done this?

Because the Crossref Labs keeps gathering new and interesting data that we want to share with our community. Having a place where we can put data from our experiments makes this easier.

This will also allow us to prototype things that may make it into Participation Reports.

### I hate it. Why doesn't it do X?

We're glad you asked. The [source is available in GitLab]() under an MIT Open Source License. We even built it with an eye toward extension. It uses standard libraries like [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) to do most of its work. And the enitre page is driven by the most excellent [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). We look forward to your pull requests!
