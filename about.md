### Warnings, Caveats and Weasel Words

This is a [Crossref Labs](https://www.crossref.org/labs/) version of our production [Particpation reports](https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/).

Trust it as you would a scorpoion sitting on your nose.

### Why have we done this?

Because the Crossref Labs keeps gathering new and interesting data that we want to share with our community. Having a place where we can put data from our experiments makes this easier.

This will also allow us to prototype things that may make it into Participation Reports.

And we've always been curious about how much we might be able to build using some of the incredible tools that have emerged for data scientists.

### Why doesn't it do X?

We're glad you asked. The [source is available in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/crossref/crossref-precipitation-reports) under an MIT Open Source License. We even built it with an eye toward extension. It uses standard libraries like [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) to do most of its work. And the enitre page is driven by the most excellent [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). We look forward to your merge requests!

### How often is the data updated?

Every night. If there is demand, we can do this more frequently. The last time the data was updated in noted at the top of the sidebar.

### Can you move the widgets 12 pixels to the right?

Probably not. Streamlit is fantastic, but it doesn't give you fine-grained control over all UI elements.

### I see that you are using dataframes and plotly in a very *cough* eccentric fashion. Are you an idiot?

Indubitably.
