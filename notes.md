## Notes


### TODO

- Update parquet files in the background.
- Add ability to link to a particular report by passing in paramters.
- ~Last date of updates~
- ~Add content-type breakdowns to overview~
- Any way to identify sponsors?
- List prefixes
- Accounting ID (associated with Sponsor)
- System ID
- Change name
- Leader-board
- Date ranges (how do these interact with current/backfile?). Issue here is that we need to precomute this. Would be good to understand use-case better. Would breakdown by year be useful. Or maybe- in addtion to current/backfile we have year-to-date and last-30 days?
- finish adding missing metadata links 
- fix for members who have no DOIs
- put approximate total
- calculate local equivalent fees


### fly
- flyctl deploy .
- flyctl restart prep
